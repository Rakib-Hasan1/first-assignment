            <p class="section-4-description">Bangladesh is a vibrant South Asian country, rich in history, culture, and
                natural beauty. Known as the "Land of Rivers," it boasts the world's largest river delta and the
                breathtaking Sundarbans, home to the Bengal tiger. Despite its small size, Bangladesh has a population
                of over 170 million, making it one of the world's most densely populated nations. The country's economy
                is driven by agriculture, textiles, and a growing technology sector. Dhaka, its bustling capital,
                reflects the nation's energy and resilience. With a history marked by the Liberation War of 1971,
                Bangladesh stands as a symbol of determination and progress.</p>
